# 🐔 Chicken Disease Classification – Backend (Flask + TensorFlow)

This project provides a backend API for detecting and classifying common chicken diseases from uploaded images. It uses a deep learning model trained with TensorFlow/Keras, and is served through a lightweight Flask API. The backend handles image uploads, performs preprocessing, feeds the image to the model, and returns the predicted disease class with confidence. Ideal for integration with mobile or web apps in poultry health management systems.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ REST API built with Flask  
- ✅ Deep learning model integration (`.h5`)  
- ✅ Accepts chicken images and returns disease predictions  
- ✅ Scalable for deployment and frontend integration  
- ✅ Includes preprocessing pipeline for inference
